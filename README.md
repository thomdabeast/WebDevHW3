**Instructions:** Using a MVC-based platform of your choice (e.g. Django, Ruby on Rails, ASP.NET MVC), write a basic blogging platform with the following functionality:
### Authentication System ###
Users must be able to log into your site. Your site should support at least two user types
* administrators that can post content, moderate comments, and authenticate users
* contributors that can post new content

### Blog Post CRUD ###
Your site should allow admins to add, edit, and delete blog posts.
### Commenting CRUD ###
Your site should allow users to add, edit, and delete comments to blog posts.
### Page Moderation ###
Admins should be able to edit and delete all blog comments.
### Adaptive CSS Layout ###
You must leverage adaptive CSS layout in order to ensure that your project performs well across a variety of screen resolutions. You may accomplish this using your own code or you may use an off the shelf framework (e.g. Bootstrap).
In addition to the content above, your project must contain instructions for deploying your website. Your project must deploy to any generic version of Linux (I will be using Arch) or Windows 8+.
